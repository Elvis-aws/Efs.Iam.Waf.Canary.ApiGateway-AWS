        Standard
        ********
        - Regional storage class for frequently accessed data
        - Offers the highest levels of availability and durability by storing file system data redundantly across
          multiple AZs in an AWS Region
        - Ideal for active file system workloads and you pay only for the file system storage you use per month
        ****************************************
        Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA)
        ****************************************
        - Regional, low-cost storage class thatâ€™s cost-optimized for files infrequently accessed i.e. not
          accessed every day
        - Offers the highest levels of availability and durability by storing file system data redundantly across
          multiple AZs in an AWS Region
        - Cost to retrieve files, lower price to store

          single AZ
        - For file systems using One Zone storage classes, only a single mount target that is in the same Availability
          Zone as the file system needs to be created
